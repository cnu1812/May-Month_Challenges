## Solution for Minimum Task Cost Problem

### Problem Statement
Given a group of workers, each with an efficiency rating, pair them up so that the cost of the task is minimized. The cost of a pair is the absolute difference between the efficiencies assigned to the workers. The cost of the task is the sum of the costs of all pairs formed. There are an odd number of workers to choose from, so one worker will not be paired. Select the worker to exclude so the task's cost is minimized.

### Approach
We can solve this problem by sorting the list of efficiency ratings and removing each worker one at a time to recalculate the total cost of the task with the remaining workers. For each iteration, we calculate the total cost of the task with the remaining workers by iterating over the remaining workers in pairs and accumulating the absolute differences in efficiency ratings. We keep track of the minimum cost seen so far and return it as the final result.

### Pseudo-code
```python
function min_task_cost(workers):
    n = length of workers
    min_cost = infinity
    sorted_workers = sort workers
    for i in range(n):
        remaining_workers = sorted_workers[:i] + sorted_workers[i+1:]
        cost = 0
        for j in range(0, n-2, 2):
            cost += abs(remaining_workers[j] - remaining_workers[j+1])
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
    return min_cost
```

### Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), as we need to sort the list of efficiency ratings and then iterate over the list n times to recalculate the total cost of the task with the remaining workers. The space complexity is O(n), as we need to create a copy of the input list to sort it.

### Example Usage
```python
workers = [1, 3, 54, 712, 52, 904, 113, 12, 135, 32, 31, 56, 23, 79, 611, 123, 677, 232, 997, 101, 111, 123, 2, 7, 24, 57, 99, 45, 666, 42, 104, 129, 554, 335, 876, 35, 15, 93, 13]
min_cost = min_task_cost(workers)
print(min_cost)
```
This will output the minimum cost of the task for the given list of efficiency ratings.
